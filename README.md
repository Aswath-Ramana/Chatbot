# Chatbot


The idea of this project was not to create some SOTA chatbot with exceptional cognitive skills but just to utilise.This was one of my very few projects, 
created when I just stepped into the world of NLP and I thought of creating a simple chatbot just to make use of my newly acquired knowledge.
